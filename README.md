# Identification-Counting-of-Human-Blood-Cells
Implemented a system for identifying and counting human blood cells using YOLO and KNN algorithms, achieving 93% accuracy on blood sample images. This project helps in diagnosing blood-related issues by detecting changes in cell count, size, and presence of bacteria, crucial for early disease detection and treatment.
